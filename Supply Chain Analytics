**Inventory analysis is the process of examining inventory to determine the optimum amount a business should carry. It refers to any calculation that helps a business better understand their inventory levels, ultimately improving cash flow, reducing stockouts and operating efficiently.
By obtaining clear picture of the inventory that keeps your company profitable, you can keep up with customer demand while increasing sales and controlling costs.
Inventory is measured and regulated according to predetermined norms such as economic lot size for order or production, safety stock, minimum level, maximum level, order level etc.**
